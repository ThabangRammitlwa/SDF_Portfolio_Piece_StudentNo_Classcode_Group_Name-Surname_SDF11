# Tailwind-css
# Learning Reflections README 
The lectures where a good guide, it explained well and i learned how to use tailwind instead of style css and javascript, Tailwin is the quickest and shortest way to style a web page and make it responsive, it can be tricky at first , but as soon as you get the hang of it , using Tailwind is fun.

### Overview
Iam intrested in understanding it fully as it looks way easier to use and short.Tailwind seem way more straight forward , I sttill would like to continue using Javascript and Style CSS , reason being i feel tailwind is easy to understand and use once you have mastered JS and CSS first. 

### Reflections
In most lectures tailwind cheatsheet was mentioned as a handy tool, and that made me realise that with a lot of abbreviation being used , one can never really know tailwind by heart, intresting that i always thought that PNG is a better format to use for pictures untils i  learned SVG. 

#### Areas of Mastery
i can safely say i have a full understanding of Grid and flex at this point, i wouldn't call it mastery as it is only the fundamental stage.  

#### Challenges Faced
Lecture 1 was complicated and long, at some point i got lost as the lecturer kept going back and forth, adding and cancelling. At the end i finally understood it after watching it 3 time, but beside that i had no challenges.

- **Code Optimization**:
 My code gave results, but i would like to do more of this without a guide maybe  to understand and probably master it.

#### Overall Learning Experience
It was challenging as it was the first time i had to do a code that long with so many div inside other divs and having so many div class. i found it intresting as i learned a whole different way of coding form other previous projects.
